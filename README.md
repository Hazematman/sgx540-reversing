PowerVR SGX540 dumping
=========
This repository contains a set of tools and reverse engineered information on the PowerVR SGX540 gpu found in the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 P3110 by samsung.

Directory structure:

`Android/` contains various analysis tools (including shader dumping tools) for android, they are mostly historial but might be useful again at some point
`hook-postmarket/` contains the latest analysis tools for postmarketos, at the moment they are able to analyse the gpu initialization and dump/modify shaders through a mostly complete armv7 debugger backend and some notes about my findings
`asm/` contains a disassembler and an assembler for the architecture, the disassembler is for now just done using hijacked official imgtech binaries (not provided in this repo)
`info/` contains general information about the drivers and the architecture

Checklist:

- [x] Implement a disassembler
- [x] Figure out how to run this on postmarketos instead
- [ ] Reverse the instruction encoding fully
- [x] Determine instruction semantics for the instructions that are commonly used in simple shaders
- [x] Implement an assembler (partial)
- [x] Implement a way of replacing shaders generated by the proprietary driver
- [ ] Finish a writeup about the entire process
- [ ] Reverse engineer PDS
- [ ] Reverse engineer the microkernel
- [ ] Perform some basic rendering independently of the userspace libgl
