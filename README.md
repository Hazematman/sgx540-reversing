PowerVR SGX540 dumping
=========
This repository contains a set of tools and reverse engineered information on the PowerVR SGX540 gpu found in the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 P3110 by samsung


All of the reverse engineering is done out on the Cyanogenmod-based Beanstalck android 6.0 rom version `6.15-20160430-espressowifi`

The tools in this repository can be build using the android studio IDE, after building the project the testing apk will be located under `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` and the intercept tool will be under `app/build/intermediates/cmake/debug/obj/armeabi-v7a/libdumper.so`

In order to use the dumper you have to first `setenforce 0` on your tablet and then `setprop wrap.com.android.gl2jni LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libdumper.so`

There is now a disassembler under the directory `data`, the exact instruction encoding still isn't fully reversed yet.

Checklist:

- [x] Implement a disassembler
- [ ] Figure out how to run this on postmarketos instead
- [ ] Reverse the instruction decoding fully
- [ ] Determine instruction semantics for the instructions that are commonly used in simple shaders
- [ ] Implement an assembler
- [ ] Implement a way of replacing shaders generated by the proprietary driver
- [ ] Reverse the command stream
- [ ] Perform some basic rendering independently of the userspace libgl
