PowerVR SGX540 dumping
=========
This repository contains a set of tools and reverse engineered information on the PowerVR SGX540 gpu found in the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 P3110 by samsung, for both Android and PostmarketOS

Checklist:

- [x] Implement a disassembler
- [x] Figure out how to run this on postmarketos instead
- [ ] Reverse the instruction encoding fully
- [x] Determine instruction semantics for the instructions that are commonly used in simple shaders
- [ ] Implement an assembler (an assembler is most likely embedded in the x86 binary)
- [x] Implement a way of replacing shaders generated by the proprietary driver
- [ ] Reverse engineer the microkernel
- [ ] Perform some basic rendering independently of the userspace libgl
